# How to use this repository

The main purpose of this repository is to allow the automatic installation of Netkit in a Debian OS.

## Download the installer

Using git:

    git clone https://github.com/redesunlu/netkit-doc.git cd netkit-doc/

Or downloading the relevant script

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redesunlu/netkit-doc/master/instalar-netkit-ng.sh

## Run the installer

The script performs all the required actions to fully install Netkit on a Linux system. It even adds packages that aren't installed by default. It will require at least 2 GB of free space, some of the packages may take a long time to download, and some steps may require root or superuser password in order to complete.

    bash instalar-netkit-ng.sh

Please pay attention to the output of the script as it will show progress and status information. After the process is finished, you will be given a way to test the installation.

## Reinstall

If it were necessary to re-do the installation, the script can be executed without having to download the "heavy" files again.

Just remove all directories inside `~/netkit/` except for the so-called `bundles`.

## Uninstall

Just remove the `~/netkit` folder and remove from `~/.bashrc` lines similar to the following:

```
export NETKIT_HOME=/home/<user>/netkit/netkit-ng
export MANPATH=:$NETKIT_HOME/man
export PATH=$PATH:$NETKIT_HOME/bin
```
